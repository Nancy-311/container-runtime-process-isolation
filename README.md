# Project MNU-OS

**Project MNU-OS** is a minimal, command-line container runtime for Linux, built in **C++17**, designed to create isolated process environments using fundamental Linux kernel features.

It acts as a lightweight container manager — creating and running sandboxed environments where applications can execute securely, with limited access to system resources.

---

## 🚀 Key Objectives

The goal of **MNU-OS** is to provide a foundation for learning and experimenting with containerization.
It can:

- **Process Isolation**  
  Leverage Linux **Namespaces** (`PID`, `Mount`, `UTS`, etc.) to isolate processes, hostnames, and filesystems.

- **Resource Control**  
  Use **Control Groups (cgroups v2)** to enforce **memory**, **CPU**, and **process count** limits.

- **Sandboxed Filesystem**  
  Provide a **separate root filesystem** for processes via `chroot` and mount namespaces, isolating containers from the host.

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  
  A simple CLI to launch containers from a **user-defined configuration**.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies

- **Programming Language**: C++17
- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Kernel Features Used**:
  - Linux **Namespaces**
  - Linux **Control Groups (cgroups v2)**
- **Build System**: [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- **Interface**: Command-Line Interface (CLI)

## 🏗️ What It Does (In Simple Terms)

Think of your operating system as a **large apartment building**.
**Project MNU-OS** is the **building manager** that creates new private apartments for applications to live in:

- 🧱 **Namespaces = Walls**  
  Put up walls so an application can't see or interfere with its neighbors.

- ⚡ **cgroups = Utility Meters**  
  Install meters to ensure no application uses too much electricity or water (CPU, RAM, processes).

- 🚪 **Filesystem Isolation = Private Rooms**  
  Give each application its own set of rooms (root filesystem), completely separated from the host.

Once the apartment is ready, the application moves in and does its work in a secure, private space.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux system with **namespace** and **cgroup v2** support
- Root privileges (required for namespace + cgroup operations)
- Build tools: `g++`, `cmake`, `make`

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MNU-OS.git
cd MNU-OS
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Usage

Run an isolated containerized command:

```bash
sudo ./mnu-os run --config ../configs/sample.json
```

This will:
1. Create new namespaces (PID, UTS, Mount).
2. Set up a new hostname.
3. Apply filesystem isolation with `chroot`.
4. Enforce **memory / CPU / process limits** via cgroups.
5. Launch the specified application.
